        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>
            My name is Emmanuel Aiyetan, and I’m a Computer Science student who enjoys building real,
            working projects—not just solving toy problems. I like working with Python, SQL, and tools
            like VS Code and GitHub to create systems that actually manage data and solve everyday
            problems.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of my favorite projects so far is a <strong>Medical Appointment System</strong>, where I
            used Python and SQL to store patient and appointment data, and built full create, view, and
            delete (CRUD) functionality. Projects like this help me connect what I’m learning in class to
            real-world scenarios.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m still early in my journey, but I’m serious about growing into a strong software engineer.
            I care about writing clear code, understanding how data moves through a system, and learning
            how to build applications that are simple, reliable, and easy to use.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of school and coding, I enjoy sports, music, and finding small ways to get better each
            day. This portfolio will keep evolving as I learn more, ship new projects, and get closer to
            internship opportunities.
